<p>The company “Lumière” was founded by a group of students from Cebu Technological University, Moalboal Campus.<br>The reason why it was named Lumière is because the company sells and produces candles but the ingredients are mostly organic.
For now, we made a candle with mint scent that is also a mosquito repellant.</br><br>Because it is made in organic, it is eco-friendly and affordable.We offer different sizes for the product called LimeLight and the sizes consist of small, medium and large.</br><br>Lumière’s target customers are students, school faculty and walk-in purchasers.
The students that are members of the company made a contribution for the capital as a starting money for the production. Our production site is located in Tunga, Moalboal, Cebu where we produce and pack the product. As for the marketing strategy, we came up with a plan to start advertising through flyers and sharing the product to our friends and colleagues.
